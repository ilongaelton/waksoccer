# 📱 Quick Expo Go Test - Alternative Approach

Since we're having some dependency conflicts, let's try a simple approach to get your app running:

## 🎯 Option 1: Create New Expo App (Fastest)

Let's create a fresh Expo app to test immediately:

### Step 1: Create Test App
```bash
# In a new terminal, go to a temp directory
cd C:\temp
npx create-expo-app@latest test-soccer --template blank-typescript
cd test-soccer
```

### Step 2: Start Test App
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Scan QR Code with Expo Go

This will give you a working QR code immediately to test Expo Go on your phone!

## 🎯 Option 2: Web Version (Works Right Now!)

While we fix the mobile version, you can test the web version:

### Start Web App
```bash
cd C:\Users\haylton ilonga\OneDrive\Bureau\waksoccer\apps\web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

This gives you the same soccer app functionality!

## 🎯 Option 3: Simplified Mobile Fix

Let me create a working mobile version for you with corrected dependencies.

The key issues were:
- ✅ Expo CLI is installed and working
- ❌ Package version conflicts  
- ❌ Missing metro bundler
