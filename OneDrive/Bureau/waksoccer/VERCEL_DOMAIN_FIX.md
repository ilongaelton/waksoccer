# 🔧 FINAL FIX: Configure Domain in Vercel

## Current Status:
✅ DNS: waksoccer.com → 216.198.79.131 (CORRECT)
✅ Vercel App: https://waksoccer-final.vercel.app (WORKING)
❌ Domain Link: Vercel doesn't know waksoccer.com = waksoccer-final

## 🎯 The Fix (2 minutes):

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `waksoccer-final` project
3. Click on it

### Step 2: Add Custom Domain
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Click **Domains** in sidebar
3. Click **Add Domain**
4. Enter: `waksoccer.com`
5. Click **Add**

### Step 3: Verify Domain
1. Vercel will show DNS instructions
2. Your DNS is already correct (216.198.79.131)
3. Vercel will verify and activate

### Step 4: Test (should work immediately)
- Visit https://waksoccer.com
- Should show your soccer app!

## 🏆 Why This Happened:
- Your DNS points to Vercel's servers ✅
- But Vercel didn't know which app to serve
- Adding the domain tells Vercel: "serve waksoccer-final at waksoccer.com"

## 🚀 Once Fixed:
- ✅ https://waksoccer.com = Your soccer app
- ✅ Professional domain live
- ✅ Ready to share with the world!

**This is the final step!** 🎉
