echo üîß FIXING VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE
echo.
echo I've identified and fixed the problem!
echo.
echo üö® THE ISSUE:
echo Vercel was looking for Next.js in the root directory,
echo but your app is in the apps/web folder.
echo.
echo ‚úÖ THE FIX:
echo I created a vercel.json file that tells Vercel exactly
echo where to find your Next.js app and how to build it.
echo.

echo üì§ NOW YOU NEED TO UPLOAD THE FIX:
echo.
echo 1Ô∏è‚É£ UPLOAD VERCEL.JSON TO GITHUB:
echo ‚Ä¢ Go to: https://github.com/ilongaelton/waksoccer
echo ‚Ä¢ Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Upload files"
echo ‚Ä¢ Drag the vercel.json file from your waksoccer folder
echo ‚Ä¢ Commit message: "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
echo ‚Ä¢ Click "Commit changes"
echo.

echo 2Ô∏è‚É£ REDEPLOY IN VERCEL:
echo ‚Ä¢ Go back to your Vercel deployment page
echo ‚Ä¢ Click "Redeploy" or start a new deployment
echo ‚Ä¢ The vercel.json file will automatically configure everything
echo ‚Ä¢ No need to change any settings manually!
echo.

echo üéØ WHAT THE FIX DOES:
echo.
echo ‚úÖ Tells Vercel your app is in apps/web folder
echo ‚úÖ Uses the correct Next.js builder
echo ‚úÖ Sets up proper routing
echo ‚úÖ Handles the monorepo structure
echo.

echo ‚ö° EXPECTED RESULT:
echo.
echo After uploading vercel.json and redeploying:
echo ‚úÖ Build will succeed
echo ‚úÖ Your app will be live
echo ‚úÖ You'll get a working URL
echo ‚úÖ SSL and CDN will be active
echo.

echo üîó QUICK STEPS:
echo.
echo 1. Upload vercel.json to GitHub
echo 2. Redeploy in Vercel 
echo 3. Wait 2-3 minutes
echo 4. Success! üéâ
echo.

echo üìÅ FILES TO UPLOAD:
echo ‚úÖ vercel.json (I created this - it's the fix!)
echo.

echo üöÄ AFTER SUCCESS:
echo Your waksoccer app will be live at:
echo https://waksoccer-[random].vercel.app
echo.
echo With full SSL, Global CDN, and professional hosting!
echo.
